#  UiPath - Base Setup

This project walks through the base setup for UiPath Studio and Orchestrator.

It is a guide to install all the components to run this, and any other, project.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Details

**Project Format:** Windows, C#

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShonHarsh/UiPath-BaseSetup


### Sample Output

```sh

```

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
